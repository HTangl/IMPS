# IMPS
Variable Impedance Selector  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HTangl/IMPS/main/Pictures/IMG20231104193532.jpg)

The IMPS is a simple pcb made to allow switching between different sets of resistors to emulate output impedance. It was made to facilitate easy testing of impedance effects on headphones and iems.  

Parts list is as follows  

10 - 1/4 watt metal film resistors of varying values  
You can use any values you want but the original inteded values were R1-10, R2-20, R3-50, R4-75, R5-100  

2 - surface mount 3.5mm ports  
There are most likely a lot of different generic ports that will work here, I used some uxcell ones

1 - 2P6T rotary switch  
This needs to have surface mount pins not through hole legs as the holes on the PCB were not designed to fit those

1 - 3.5mm male to 3.5mm male cable  
For connecting the IMPS input to desired source device
